Using the Etsy API

##assignment
Take an array of Etsy item objects and render them with jQuery. Try to emulate the visual style of the item thumbnails that Etsy uses in their web interface, minus the sidebar, header, footer, nav, etc: 

I played around slightly with different stylings.

The tags I'm using to generate the data are "plush dog toy"
